# Stegranographic encoding

Stegranographic encoding of data into image using DWT and DCT.

## Credits

An implementation of [Ali Al-Haj, Combined DWT-DCT dicital image watermarking, September 2007](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/26621646_Combined_DWT-DCT_digital_image_watermarking)

Uses [reedsolomon.js](https://github.com/cho45/reedsolomon.js/)

## Usage

The project is fully static. You can host on any static html hosting server by pointing or uploading the files in this repo. I specifically used python

```
$ python -m http.server
```

A live version of it hosted on my [github page](https://vv4t.github.io/demo/steganography/).
